# LlamaIndex Starter Agent

A powerful AI agent template built with LlamaIndex that demonstrates how to create intelligent agents using the LlamaIndex framework. This starter project implements a Task Management Assistant using the Nebius AI model to showcase LlamaIndex's capabilities in building practical AI applications.

## Features

- 🛠️ **LlamaIndex Integration**: Built using LlamaIndex's powerful agent framework
- ⏱️ **Custom Tools**: Example implementation of custom function tools
- 🤖 **ReAct Agent**: Demonstrates LlamaIndex's ReAct agent pattern
- 📊 **Practical Example**: Task management assistant with real-world use cases
- ⚡ **Easy to Extend**: Well-structured code for adding your own tools and functionality

## Tech Stack

- Agno framework for AI agent development
- Nebius AI's for running LLMs.  We are using `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B` reasoning model 
- HackerNews Tool from Agno

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Nebius API key (get it from [Nebius AI Studio](https://studio.nebius.ai/))

## Installation

**1. Get the code**

```bash
git   clone    https://github.com/nebius/ai-studio-cookbook/
cd    agents/llamaindex-task-timer
```

**2. Install dependencies:**

```bash
# create a venv and install dependencies
uv  sync
```

Or install using python pip

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3 - Create .env file**

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Nebius API key:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

```
NEBIUS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Running the agent 

**Using `uv`**

```bash
uv  sync
uv  run   python agent.py
```

**Using python pip**

```bash
python agent.py
```

The agent will start with a welcome message and show available capabilities. You can interact with it by typing your questions or commands.

### Example Implementation

This starter implements a Task Management Assistant with the following capabilities:

- Duration Analysis: Calculate time durations between tasks
- Task Estimation: Estimate completion times for multiple tasks
- Productivity Tracking: Calculate and analyze productivity rates

Example queries:

- "If I worked from 09:00 to 17:00 and completed 8 tasks, what was my productivity rate?"
- "How long will it take to complete 3 tasks that each take 45 minutes?"
- "Calculate the duration between 09:00 and 17:00"


## Extending the Agent

To add your own functionality:

1. Create new function tools using `FunctionTool.from_defaults()`
2. Add your tools to the agent's tool list
3. Implement your custom logic in the functions
